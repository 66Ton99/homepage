# 66ton99.org.ua

Static site served by nginx on the OCI edge VM.

## Layout

```
site/                       mirrors /var/www/66ton99.org.ua exactly
  _pages/                   page HTML, not publicly reachable (nginx `internal`)
    index.html                -> https://66ton99.org.ua/
    uk-index.html             -> https://66ton99.org.ua/uk
    awg-to-amps.html          -> https://66ton99.org.ua/awg-to-amps
    uk-awg-to-amps.html       -> https://66ton99.org.ua/uk/awg-to-amps

src/                        generator for the pages
deploy.sh                   rsync to the server
```

Pages live under `_pages/` so that each one has exactly one public URL. nginx maps
the extensionless URL onto the file with `try_files` and marks `/_pages/` as
`internal`, so there is no `.html` duplicate for search engines to index.

**If you maintain that config: do not add an `index` directive to the vhost.** `index` issues an internal
redirect to `/index.html` which re-enters location matching; combined with a
`= /index.html` redirect back to `/` it loops forever and takes the homepage
down. `try_files` resolves a file in place without re-entering, which is why
every page — the homepage included — is wired up with `try_files` instead.

## Generating the pages

Every page exists in English and Ukrainian, generated from one template per page
type so the two languages cannot drift apart.

- `src/template.html` / `src/build.py` — the AWG page: content, translations,
  JSON-LD, the data table, `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`
- `src/template-home.html` / `src/build_home.py` — the homepage
- `src/system-map.svg` — homepage artwork, inlined as a data URI at build time
  with its labels translated per language
- `src/make_og.py` — the four 1200×630 Open Graph cards
- `src/test.js` — jsdom checks of the calculator against the rendered pages,
  including the DC / AC 1-phase / AC 3-phase behaviour
- `src/make_home_template.py` — one-shot, only rerun if the homepage is redesigned

```bash
cd src
python3 build.py        # AWG pages + robots.txt + sitemap.xml
python3 build_home.py   # homepages
python3 make_og.py      # ../site/og-*.png
npm install --no-save jsdom && node test.js
```

Edit content in `src/build.py`, never in `site/_pages/*.html` — those are build
output and get overwritten.

## Deploy

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

`site/` mirrors the web root exactly, so this is a plain `rsync --delete`:
whatever is committed here is what gets served.

The nginx/NixOS configuration is **not** in this repo — it names internal
addresses, so it lives in a separate private one. The notes below describe how
it is wired, which is what you need to understand the URLs.

## Contributing

Corrections to the ampacity data are welcome, especially with a datasheet or
standard to back them. The AWG 24–30 rows are the least certain: they are
indicative for fine-stranded silicone wire rather than taken from one
authoritative table.

Edit `src/build.py`, never `site/_pages/*.html` — those are build output. Run
`python3 build.py && node test.js` before opening a pull request.

## The DC / AC toggle

The toggle above the table is deliberately honest about what it does and does
not change.

**Ampacity does not change.** At 50–60 Hz the skin depth in copper is ~9.4 mm,
while even a 0 AWG conductor has a 4.1 mm radius. Per IEC 60287-1-1 the
resistance rise is 0.08 % at 0 AWG and under 0.01 % below 4 AWG — far inside the
spread between manufacturers' datasheets. Publishing separate DC and AC ampacity
columns would be inventing precision that is not there, so the table's numbers
stay put and the note under it explains why.

**Voltage drop does change**, and that is the point:

| | drop | I²R conductors |
|---|---|---|
| DC | `2·I·R·L` | 2 |
| AC 1-phase | `2·I·R·L·cos φ` | 2 |
| AC 3-phase | `√3·I·R·L·cos φ` | 3 |

The AC modes also expose a frequency input, because skin effect does matter
higher up: 0 AWG picks up 4.7 % at 400 Hz. The IEC fit holds for xs ≤ 2.8
(~1 kHz on the largest gauge), and above that the calculator flags its own
output as indicative rather than silently extrapolating.

Reactance is neglected throughout — at these cross-sections and run lengths it
is below the uncertainty in the resistance, but that assumption breaks on long
three-phase runs in conduit.

Mode is stored in `localStorage`, not in the URL, so it does not create
crawlable duplicates of the page.

## SEO notes

- The ampacity table is rendered into static HTML at build time, not by JavaScript,
  so crawlers see all 17 rows without executing scripts.
- `en` / `uk` / `x-default` hreflang triples are declared on all four pages and
  in `sitemap.xml`, and each page confirms its partner reciprocally.
- JSON-LD per page: `Organization`, `WebSite`, `WebPage`, `ImageObject`,
  `BreadcrumbList`, `WebApplication`, `Dataset`, `FAQPage`.
- Canonical URLs are the extensionless HTTPS ones.
